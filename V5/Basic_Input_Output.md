# Basic Input/Output in C++

C++ provides libraries that assist in performing input and output operations. In C++, sequences of bytes corresponding to input and output are commonly referred to as **streams**.

## Streams

- **Input Stream:** The direction of the flow of bytes is from input devices (like keyboard) to the main memory (program).
  
- **Output Stream:** The direction of the flow of bytes is from the main memory to the output devices (like monitor or console).
