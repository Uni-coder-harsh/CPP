VAIRIABLE
-A variable is a container to hold data
-Variable can be of various types . primarily we have 
@ int 1,2...
@ float 1.2,2.11,3.54 ...
@ char 'a','db'.....
@ double 1.234242424232 ,3.14525263253 ...
@ Boolean  True=1/False=0

- **int sum=34;**  means sum is a integer variable which holds value 34 in memory


SYNTAX FOR DECLARING VARIABLES IN C++
-**Data_type Variable_name=Value;**
-Example = **int a=4,b=6;**
Based on Scope , variable can by classified into 2 types
1. Local Variable
2. Global variable

VARIABLE SCOPE
-Scope of a variable is the region in code where the excistence of variable is valid
-**LOCAL VARIABLES :** local variable are declared inside the braces of any function and can be accessed only from there
-**GLOBAL VARIABLE :** globale variable are declares outside any function and can be accessed from anywhere 
-**can global variable and local variable have same name in C++** - yes 

**C++ DATA TYPES**
-data types define the type of data a variable can hold , for examle an integer variable can  hold integer data, character type can hold character data
-Data types in C++ are categorised in 3 types 
1. **Built-in**
2. **User-defined**
3. **Derived**


 **Built-in**
@ int 1,2...
@ float 1.2,2.11,3.54 ... decimal of low precision
@ char 'a','db'.....
@ double 1.234242424232 ,3.14525263253 ... decimal of high precision
@ Boolean  True/False


**User-defined**
-Struct
-Union
-Enum


**Derived**
-Array
-Function
-Pointer
